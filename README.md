# RTL to GDSII Design of Control Unit for EVM

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **Register Transfer Level (RTL) design** of the **Control Unit** for an **Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)**. The control unit plays a crucial role in the functioning of an EVM, controlling the flow of data, operation of the machine, and ensuring secure and accurate voting results.

The design is implemented in **Verilog** , and the primary goal is to demonstrate how a control unit in a voting machine can be efficiently designed using RTL principles and then converted to its GDSII file.

## Introduction

The **Control Unit** (CU) of the **EVM** is responsible for organising various functional components, ensuring that voting operations are securely carried out. The design involves:

- **Voting data input** {voter selection from Ballot unit(which is considered as a 16:4 encoder), button presses on the CU itself}
- **Memory components** (to store voter information and vote tally)
- **Proper Sequencr of flow** (Algorithm for the correct movement of data and to ensure security)
- **Display output** (status and results)

This project is aimed at providing a basic yet robust understanding of how RTL can be used to implement a control unit that coordinates all these processes and enhances some features compared to the current worling system.

## Design Architecture

The architecture consists of the following modules:

- **Control Logic:** Manages the sequential flow of operations within the EVM.
- **Data Path:** Handles the data movement between the registers, memory, and output.
- **Clock Control:** Synchronizes the operations of the control unit and the other components.
- **Input/Output Interface:** Facilitates communication with external buttons and the display.

## Key Features of the Design:

- **Finite State Machine (FSM):** The control unit uses an FSM for managing the sequence of operations during a vote.
- **Modular Design:** The project is divided into several modules for better scalability and reusability.
- **Secure Operation:** It ensures tamper-proof functionality, preventing unauthorized votes.

## Getting Started
